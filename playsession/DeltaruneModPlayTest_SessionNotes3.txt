Deltarune Terraria Mod v1.3 PlayTest Summary 3

I've finished going through most of the new additions to the mod, and I've recorded my findings here, as well as notes
on the WIP Boss's Phase 2. I've included some suggestions to implement for the boss, so pleae take a look at them.

Please look through my notes, and if you wish to implement some changes based on my findings, feel free to do so.
I've also included some grammar fixes to the item descriptions that I felt were necessary.

==========================
            NPCs
==========================

Star runner:

-Recommend changing name to [Grammar Fix]:
 Star Runner
-Please make it so Star Runner does not drop coins.

froggit:

-Recommend changing name to [Grammar Fix]:
 Froggit
-Froggit seems to use Slime AI.


==========================
            Bosses
==========================

Starwalker:

- Summon works properly
- Boss AI functions normally.
- Has balanced damage in phase 1.
- Drops Lesser Healing Potions when killed
- Drops about less than 15 Silver Coins

Phase 2 Starwalker:

- Overhead Dash attack executed well.
- Phase 2 Orbit too fast. Unable to land good hits. Recommend slowing orbit speed.
 - Recommend changing this attack to a slightly sped up orbit speed, while shooting a single projectile aimed at the player every .25s while orbiting player.
- Phase 2 Starwalker is moderately difficult, but is easier with Pre-WoF weapons.
- Recommend reducing Phase 2 Dash damage by 15

==========================
