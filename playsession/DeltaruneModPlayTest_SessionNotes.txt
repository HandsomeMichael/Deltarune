Deltarune Terraria Mod v1.3 PlayTest Summary


I've finished going through most of the new additions to the mod, and I've recorded my findings here.
Please look through my notes, and if you wish to implement some changes based on my findings, feel free to do so.
I've also included some grammar fixes to the item descriptions that I felt were necessary.

- Not sure how to summon, if there even is a summon yet.

move.

- Very hard to move during fight.

           Notes
==========================

- NPC Despawn Bug has been fixed. Town NPCs will no longer despawn randomly when dialogue box/shop is open for an extended period of time.
- Background effect are a bit hard on the eyes, may want to add an option to disable.
  - Background effect also has a noticeable impact on performance.
- Reduced performance when fighting Saness

==========================
      Suggestions
==========================

- Maybe add a base for the dummy upgrades as a crafting material
- Consider giving the Short Menacing Ax and Brave Ax the ability to chop trees, maybe about 65% - 70% Axe Power
- Add crafting recipies for the various wooden shortswords and other weapons
- Consider nerfing the Nurse Magik Spell Cooldown to 120s, and to a 50% heal instead of Full Heal (This is for
balancing purposes, this item is very un-balanced.)

==========================
        Bugs Found
==========================

- When hovering over the Spell Bag, the chat is flooded with lines of text containing a single 0.
- Text sometimes gets cut off in NPC dialogue.
- Clicking on the dialogue box causes it to repeat the appearing animation.
- Using Life Crystals / Life Fruits / Mana Crystals causes your TP Gauge to Decrease
