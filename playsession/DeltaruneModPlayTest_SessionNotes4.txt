Deltarune Terraria Mod v1.3 PlayTest Summary 4

I've finished going through most of the new additions to the mod, and I've recorded my findings here, as well as notes
on the WIP Boss's Phase 2. I've included some suggestions to implement for the boss, so pleae take a look at them.

Please look through my notes, and if you wish to implement some changes based on my findings, feel free to do so.
I've also included some grammar fixes to the item descriptions that I felt were necessary.

MAKE ANY NECESSARY GRAMMAR FIXES/ CHANGES BEFORE RELEASING!!!

==========================
      Extra Features
==========================

Starting Items (In Char. Creation)

- Starting item feature fully functions as intended, consider downgrading mage weapon to an Emerald Staff for balancing.


==========================
            NPCs
==========================
-Froggit seems to use Slime AI.


Ralsei

- AI seems to have a bit of trouble getting out of holes.
- Cannot be butchered.
- Recommend adding more dialogue and/or a shop.
- Has some sort of odd Red/Yellow box when you hover cursor over a certain area around Ralsei.

==========================
            Bosses
==========================

Starwalker:

- Summon works properly
- Boss AI functions normally.
- Has balanced damage in phase 1.
- Drops Healing Potions when killed
- Drops about 25 Gold Coins
==========================
           Items
==========================

Short Menacing Ax

- Suggest editing the Item Description [Grammar Fix]:
Slash attacks inflicts Fatal Bleeding
Enemies that have Fatal Bleeding bleeding take more chop damage
Hitting an enemy 10 times will summon a flying axe
- Axe can chop down trees.
- Special bleeding effect functions as intended.

Babagun

- Suggest editing the Item Description [Grammar Fix]:
Shoots a spread of 4 frozen bullets
Right Click to shoot a bullet tracker
Bullet tracker will direct bullets towards target
- Functions as intended.
- Suggest adding this as one of Starwalkers drops in a future update


Corrupted Tin & Crimtaned Copper

- Looks cool, doesn't really seem to have a practical use
- Has the issue of a world having Copper & Corruption, and vice versa

Banana

Bell of Stars

- Add a crafting recipe for the bell. (MUST DO BEFORE RELEASE v0.1.3!!!)


Dummy Knockback 1-3

- All Upgrades function as intended.


Sword Bullet
