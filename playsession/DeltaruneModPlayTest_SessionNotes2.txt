Deltarune Terraria Mod v1.3 PlayTest Summary 2

I've finished going through most of the new additions to the mod, and I've recorded my findings here, as well as notes
on the new Boss Fight.
Please look through my notes, and if you wish to implement some changes based on my findings, feel free to do so.
I've also included some grammar fixes to the item descriptions that I felt were necessary.

==========================
            Bosses
==========================

Starwalker:

- Summon works properly
- Boss AI functions normally.
- Orbit attack is a tad difficult to dodge.
- Dash attack easier to dodge with the use of dashes
- Hover attack is a bit stiff, hard to dodge all projectiles in this attack.
Recommend making it follow the player just a tiny bit loosely
- Has balanced damage.
- Arena is Highly Recommended to be used when fighting against
- Drops Lesser Healing Potions when killed
- Drops about less than 15 Silver Coins

==========================
           Items
==========================

Tough Glove

- Suggest editing the Item + Item Description:

Corrupted Tin & Crimtaned Copper
- Looks cool, doesn't really seem to have a practical use
- Has the issue of a world having Copper & Corruption, and vice versa
